The "compit.sh" file here will be the compilation shell script for the Java code.

Both the compilation and execute scripts will refer to the "Jackson" product,
which allows Java program to read and write JSON structured data.

This is very similar to the requirements of the AUTHOR program, also
present in this GITHUB area.
