This example will show how it is possible to create the
"yes/no" decision tree and endpoint HTML files.

While the output of this example will work to some
extent, note that it is dependent for its meaning on
images of machine cancellations created in the late 19th
and early 20th century in the United States. Those images
are not being supplied for this example.
